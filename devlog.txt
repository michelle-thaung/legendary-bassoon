- Created four templates
    - general.html -> general blog page (what the user sees first if they are already logged in)
    - login_or_register.html -> page that allows you to go to the login or the register page (what the user sees first if they are not logged in)
    - login.html -> login page
    - register.html -> register page
- Updated __init__.py
    - root() redirects the user to general.html or login_or_register.html depending on login status
    - register() will handle registration
    - credentialsWork() will return whether session credentials are in the database and work

- Finished login and registration
    - login and registration pages have their own errors for when there is nothing inputted
    - login page has errors for incorrect credentials
    - registration page have errors for mismatching passwords, user already existing, and when there is non-alphanumeric characters in the username
    - registration page leads to a successful registration page that has a button leading to the login page
    - after a successful login, the pages lead to the general page
- db.py will now contain all database operations because there were problems with cursors being created on different threads and this solved it (idea borrowed from team RIID)
- setup databases to contain usernames and passwords (users table) and usernames and their blog names (blogs table)
- add .gitignore to ignore .db files and app/__pycache__/
